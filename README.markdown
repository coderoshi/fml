# FML

The FAQ Markup Language. It's pretty simple. The gem is called `faqml`, so first install it.

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'faqml'
data = File.readlines('mypage.fml').join()
puts FML.new(data).to_html

# Or better yet, use Tilt
puts Tilt.new('mypage.fml').render
```

Your markup in `mypage.fml` should be valid markdown. The only difference is, that QnA blocks are started by three dashes (`---`), and questions and answers are seperated by three equals (`===`). The first line of the question block will be the QnA's title. That's all.
